more diverse version. But the rewritten question must be reasonable, understandable, and
answerable by humans.

You SHOULD diversify the given question using the following methods:
1. Replace problem scenarios.
2. Draw inspiration from the #Given Question# to create a brand new question.

#Rewritten Question# must be a solvable problem independent of the #Given Question#.
